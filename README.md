# Getting Started

Clone first the whole project to your local. Do not forget to install and run ***MongoDB*** before
running the application.

## Scripts

Inside the project directory, you should run:

### `mvn clean install`

This installs all the dependencies needed to start the application and runs all the test scripts.\
\
After that, run:

### `mvn spring-boot:run`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Access the APIs at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

You're good to go!
